//Introduction to the object
// in object we give the property to the string such as the jonas
// is the name and we cannot give the proprty to it as it is first name or last name
// but we can do this with the help of the object
// we basically use the object when we want the data to be unstructed and array when data is structerd
// it is the same as the key and the value pair

let objects = {
  firstname: 'yashu',
  lastname: 'Sharma',
  age: 21,
  friends: ['no', 'one'],
};

// here the data will be in the unordered form

console.log(objects);
