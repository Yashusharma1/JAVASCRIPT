//Var , Const, let

// we use let and var when we want to change the value of the variable after some time in the code

let charcter = "name ";
console.log(charcter);
charcter = " Sharma";
console.log(charcter);

// var is same as let but we usally use let Keyword

var charctera = "ben";
console.log(charctera);
charctera = "ten";
console.log(charctera);
// const is used when we do not want to change the value of the variable and it should remain same throught out the code

const dateOfBirth = "12/01/2002";
console.log(dateOfBirth);
//  dateOfBirth = "ben";  This will show the typing error
